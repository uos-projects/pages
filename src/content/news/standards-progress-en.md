## Standards Development Progress

The UOS project has made significant progress in standards development. The project team has completed the first drafts of resource model standards and communication interaction standards, and has conducted preliminary validation work in the power information sector.

## Standards System

The project has established a standards system that includes:

1. **Resource Model Standards**: Defining resource abstraction and description specifications in human-cyber-physical convergence scenarios
2. **Communication Interaction Standards**: Specifying communication protocols between different levels and types of entities
3. **Application Collaboration Standards**: Establishing interface and process specifications for inter-application collaboration

## Industry Validation

The draft standards have been preliminarily validated in pilot applications in the power information industry. Multiple power companies participated in the review and improvement of the standards, providing valuable practical feedback.

## Future Work

The project team will continue to refine the standards system, expand the application scope of the standards, and actively promote their application in more industrial sectors, fostering the healthy development of the human-cyber-physical convergence operating system ecosystem.
