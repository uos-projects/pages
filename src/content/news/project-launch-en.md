## Official Project Launch

On December 22, 2024, the "Human-Cyber-Physical Convergence Operating System Technology R&D for Power Information Scenarios" project was officially launched at Nanjing University. The project is led by Nanjing University, with participation from Jiangsu NJU Shangcheng Hi-Tech Industrial Co., Ltd. and Shandong Zhongchuang Software Commercial Middleware Co., Ltd.

## Kickoff Meeting

The project kickoff meeting was held at Nanjing University, bringing together researchers and technical experts from the three participating institutions. The meeting also invited experts from Fudan University, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the Electric Power Research Institute of State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co., Ltd., engaging in extensive discussions on the project domain and technical approaches. The meeting clarified the overall objectives, phased tasks, and collaboration mechanisms of the project.

## Project Objectives

This project aims to break through the technical limitations of existing industrial IoT platforms and develop an industrial internet operating system that fully supports human-cyber-physical convergence applications. The project will focus on the power information sector, promoting the upgrade and development of industrial internet software platforms through technological innovation and standards development.

## Future Outlook

The project team will steadily advance research work according to the established plan, striving to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies, standards, and industrial applications of the human-cyber-physical convergence operating system, contributing to the development of China's industrial internet.
