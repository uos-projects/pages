## Workshop Overview

On January 10, 2025, the UOS project team held its first technical workshop in Nanjing. Technical experts from all participating institutions engaged in in-depth discussions on the core technical system of the human-cyber-physical convergence operating system.

## Main Topics

The workshop focused on the following technical topics:

- **Ubiquitous Connectivity Technology**: How to achieve seamless connection and orderly interaction of all production elements
- **Software-Defined Architecture**: Modular design and configurability implementation of the operating system
- **Intelligence-Driven Mechanisms**: Technical solutions for intelligent resource management and adaptive application runtime

## Technical Breakthroughs

During the meeting, the team reached preliminary consensus on operating system kernel architecture design, resource abstraction models, and communication protocol specifications, laying a solid foundation for subsequent technical development work.

## Next Steps

The project team will launch prototype development of core modules according to the technical roadmap determined at the workshop, and plans to complete preliminary technical verification in the second quarter.
