        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The Human-Cyber-Physical Convergence Operating System represents a new stage in the development 
          of industrial internet software platforms. In design philosophy, it embodies the new system 
          construction concept of "scenario as computer" and implements first principles by controlling 
          system complexity through software. In technical implementation, it integrates the new 
          technological system of "ubiquitous connectivity," "software-defined," and "intelligence-driven." 
          In ecosystem building, it constructs platform foundations for diverse and variable domain 
          applications and devices, while providing an inclusive development environment for industry communities.
        </p>

        <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          The research objectives of this project cover two levels: technology and standards & ecosystem.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Technical Level</h3>
        <p>
          The project aims to break through the limitations of existing industrial IoT platforms that 
          rely on the elementary approach of IT+OT for industrial upgrading. Following the proper 
          architecture of operating systems, we will develop an industrial internet operating system 
          that fully supports human-cyber-physical convergence applications. This system will support 
          orderly interaction of all production elements, implement intelligent resource management 
          and evolvable application runtime, ensuring flexible adjustment and optimization when facing 
          different production demands and environmental changes.
        </p>

        <h3>Standards & Ecosystem Level</h3>
        <p>
          The project selects the power information sector as the target industry for technical verification 
          and promotion. Through the development and formulation of resource model standards, communication 
          interaction standards, application collaboration standards, etc., we promote the development of 
          the human-cyber-physical convergence operating system ecosystem in the power information field. 
          This will not only enhance the intelligence level and collaborative efficiency of the power industry, 
          but also provide reference and standards for other industrial production fields, promoting the 
          adaptation and implementation of these research results in more industries, and comprehensively 
          achieving the optimization of production chains and the reshaping of the entire industrial and value chains.

        <h2>Project Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Through a compatible development route, we aim to achieve catch-up with international advanced 
          levels, ensuring that the developed technologies and standards can not only be widely applied 
          domestically but also align with international standards, making technical contributions to 
          China's transformation from a manufacturing powerhouse to a manufacturing leader.
